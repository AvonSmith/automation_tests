# This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive example of automation testing for web applications using a combination of different tools.

### UI tests
>For UI testing, the repository leverages the _Selenium WebDriver_ tool along with the Actions Class to interact with the UI and simulate user actions. The __Page Object__ and __Page Factory__ patterns are used to encapsulate the elements and their interactions on a specific page, making the tests more readable and maintainable. All UI tests are run using the __TestNG__ framework, which provides a range of features to support test execution, such as parallel testing and test configuration through XML files. Additionally, the implementation supports __cross-browser testing__, allowing for the same tests to be run on multiple browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.


### API tests
>For REST API testing, the repository uses __JUnit__ as the test framework, combined with the __Cucumber__ tool for behavior-driven development (__BDD__). The __Rest Assured__ library is used to send HTTP requests and validate the responses from the API. This setup allows for clear and concise test scenarios to be written using the Gherkin syntax, while leveraging the power of JUnit to run and assert the tests.

Overall, this GitHub repository serves as a complete reference for setting up an automation testing environment for web applications. By using a combination of these tools, it provides a powerful and flexible solution for validating the functionality of both the UI and the APIs.
